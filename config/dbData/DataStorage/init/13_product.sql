The Stainless Steel used in all Futuro Futuro products is of the highest quality for kitchen hoods, AISI 304.

To make this simple hood even easier to use they added an illuminated electronic control panel to control every function of the hood. You can easily set a delayed shut off timer so the hood will continue to run for 15 minutes after shutting it off.

To keep your kitchen clean and fresh no matter what you’re cooking, the Amalfi series uses a high powered 940 CFM Internal Whisper tangential blower. This blower alone would make for a quiet hood that would satisfy most users, but Futuro Futuro doesn’t stop there. They implemented a cutting edge multi-layered sound absorbing panel, so you won’t even notice when your kitchen hood is running until you take a deep breath of fresh air. A perimeter suction filtration system provides highly effective filtration while concealing the metal mesh grease filters behind a sleek panel keeping in line with a strict cubist design. This system draws air to the edges of the hood creating an air curtain around your stovetop to ensure all of the smoke, grease, and smells are fully filtered. The illuminated, electronic control panel even sends you a convenient reminder when it’s time to clean the easily removable, dishwasher safe filters. You can also use any of the features packed into this hood with the simple push of a button. With two long lasting, energy efficient LED lights you’ll never be wondering whether or not your medium-rare steak is cooked to perfection again. The lights are perfectly positioned to create a focus on your stovetop that diffuses out to the rest of your kitchen. The 36-Inch Amalfi Wall Range Hood has a strict cubist design perfect for adding a modern flair to any kitchen. Made with premium Italian craftsmanship, the highest quality materials available, and innovative technology, this hood is built to last.

This lets the craftsmen rest easy knowing the work they put into perfecting each and every aspect of the hood will stay that way for years to come. To provide filtration for an entire room, a powerful 940 CFM Internal Whisper blower has to be used. You’re probably wondering if a powerful blower like this will fill your room with noise. Well you can rest assured it won’t. To solve this issue Futuro Futuro developed an innovative sound absorbing chamber with a patented design to ensure even the highest powered blowers always remain as quiet as a mouse. The Skylight Ceiling/Soffit Range Hood brings you the latest and greatest in filtration technology, a perimeter suction system. What makes a perimeter suction system so amazing is the way it directs airflow to the outer edges of the hood preventing any air from escaping its capture area. This air is run through metal mesh grease filters that are easy to remove and dishwasher safe. To make sure you’re always getting a clean filtration the electronic control panel will let you know when it’s time to clean out these filters by just tossing them in your dishwasher. The control panel is remote controlled giving you easy access to all of the features this hood has to offer like a 15-minute delayed shut off timer and four adjustable speeds. Illumination from this hood comes from two LED light strips that will brighten your entire kitchen with a focus on your stovetop. LED lights give you a long-lasting, energy efficient lighting option. Futuro Futuro has built a reputation for always delivering high quality kitchen ventilation solutions that are built to look as good as they work. sku: IS38SKYLIGHT', 500, 'a0eebc99-9c0b-4ef8-bb6d-6bb9bd380a11', '38-skylight-ceiling-soffit-range-hood', '4250', '2895', '0', 'a0eebc99-9c0b-4ef8-bb6d-6bb9bd380a11', '101', '48', '40', '21', 'Range Hood 38-inch Skylight Ceiling/Soffit Built-in by Futuro Futuro', 'Futuro Futuro Skylight 38 Inch Ceiling Range Hood, Unique In-Ceiling Design, Remote Control, Ultra-Quiet, with Blower', '022099538608', '684', 'Kitchen Range Hood > Island Mount > Glass > 38-inch');

This hood is the perfect combination of old-school looks and cutting edge technology making for a high powered, high quality hood with class. This hood’s design heavily relies on the fine Italian craftsmanship Futuro Futuro is known for because of its unique curves and intricate ceramic panels. These craftsmen are able to sculpt the highest grade of AISI 304 Stainless Steel used in this hood as though it were clay. This is how they are able to meet the stringent quality control standards Futuro Futuro requires. The high grade AISI 304 Stainless Steel is made to stand up to the grease and grime of a heavily used kitchen due to its high resistance to both rust and corrosion. This lets you rest assured knowing your hood will look great for years to come just like the finest pieces of antique Italian furniture. Just because this hood was designed to look like it could fit in an old Western saloon does not mean it can’t be packed full of high end technology. A powerful 940 CFM Internal Whisper tangential blower packs a punch just like an old Colt Peacemaker still packs a punch today. Even though this blower packs a punch, it barely makes a noise thanks to Futuro Futuro’s cutting edge technology behind their innovative sound absorbing chamber. It cuts back the noise to barely audible levels. Filtration in this hood comes from easy to remove, dishwasher safe metal mesh grease filters. This provides for a low maintenance solution allowing you to simply toss the filters into the dishwasher whenever they start to build up grime. A simple slider control panel makes it as easy as it could be to switch between the three adjustable speeds.

To make this hood, fine Italian craftsmen start by sculpting the body of the hood with the highest grade AISI 304 Stainless Steel. Then they apply a semi-gloss white enamel finish that is durable to help prevent any scratches or blemishes. This all makes for a low maintenance hood that can always immediately be restored to a like-new condition with just the swipe of a rag. In keeping with minimalist values of quality over quantity, a 940 CFM Internal Whisper tangential blower brings you all the power you could need in a kitchen hood without any of the noise. This low noise profile hood is made possible through Futuro Futuro’s cutting edge developments in sound absorbing chambers. It brings the noise of this hood down to barely audible levels so you can restore the sanctity of your kitchen. The filtration in this hood comes from easy to remove, dishwasher safe metal mesh grease filters that provide a time tested filtration system. This offers a low-maintenance yet highly effective solution to kitchen ventilation. When these filters are due for a cleaning, the minimalist control panel sends you a convenient reminder ensuring your hood is always running at peak efficiency. From this same control panel you can switch between any of the four adjustable speeds, set a delayed shut-off timer, and control the four long lasting, energy efficient LED lights with just the touch of a button. The 36-Inch Minimal White Island Range Hood has minimalist values at the heart of its design with a low-profile appearance, high quality craftsmanship and materials, and cutting edge technology. sku: IS36MINIMALWHT', 120, 'a0eebc99-9c0b-4ef8-bb6d-6bb9bd380a11', '36-minimal-white-island-range-hood', '2650', '1795', '0', 'a0eebc99-9c0b-4ef8-bb6d-6bb9bd380a11', '93', '48', '40', '24', 'Range Hood 36-inch Minimal White Island by Futuro Futuro', 'Futuro Futuro Minimal White 36 Inch Island-mount Range Hood, Modern, White Enamel Steel, LED, Ultra-Quiet, with Blower', '022099538578', '684', 'Kitchen Range Hood > Island Mount > Stainless Steel > 36-inch');

This is why Futuro Futuro hoods look great year after year no matter what grease and grime you throw at them. As firm believers in constant improvement, Futuro Futuro has continued to develop innovative technology for kitchen ventilation. One of the improvements recently made is a patented sound-absorbing chamber. This is how a residential kitchen blower can use a high powered Internal Whisper tangential blower that is normally reserved for commercial kitchens. By placing this blower inside the sound-absorbing chamber it gives you the power of a commercial kitchen hood without any of the noise. This is how the Lineare series hoods keeps your kitchen clean and quiet at all times. The Lineare series features chrome baffle filters that are easy to remove and dishwasher safe. An illuminated electronic control panel will even remind you when it’s time to clean them. From this control panel you can also easily set a 15-minute delayed shut off timer or change between any of the four adjustable speeds to fit your needs. Futuro Futuro’s Lineare Island Range Hoods have four LED lights mounted in each corner. This gives you a balanced light that highlights your stove top and melds out to your countertop making prep work a breeze.

With its elegant lines and sleek design, the "Balance Island" range hood from Futuro Futuro is the perfect finishing touch for high-end modern kitchens. To make a kitchen appliance that performs as great as it looks, we combined high-end materials with advanced filtration technology, multiple installation options, and quiet operation.
The “Balance" vent hood is available in 3 colors (Pure Black, Matte Charcoal, and Opaque White), so it will work with any kitchen design or color scheme. The mounting system is highly
adaptable - this hood can be installed over an island, by a wall, or even in front of a window or under a soffit box or angled ceiling. Generous 36" width designed for popular cooktop sizes - 24", 30", and 36". For larger cooking surfaces, or kitchens with multiple cooktops, you can simply hang additional units.
The Charcoal edition of this range hood accommodates kitchens in shades of blue, green, brown, and gray. It''s meant to blend into its environment, providing quiet performance without commanding the view.
Four speed options, from 150 to 940 CFM, are provided by the powerful, yet quiet blower. "Perimeter Suction System" enhances airflow by drawing air into collector slots around a deflector panel, creating an air-curtain effect that improves capture performance and distributes suction more evenly around the entire width of the unit. Moreover, the deflector panel reduces noise and conceals the mesh filters until they are removed for dishwasher cleaning.
For smooth and even illumination, an LED strip surrounds the perimeter. By replicating natural daylight, the 3000K color balance allows you to see your culinary creations exactly as they are.
A patented "Air Loop" recirculating system filters odors by using special "Micro Carbon Infusion Filter" cartridges that last up to FIVE YEARS. As opposed to the traditional charcoal filters that must be replaced every 2-3 months, this is a significant reduction in ongoing expenses and hassle. Micropores in the activated charcoal granules permanently capture odors, and the purified air is released back into the kitchen.
A high-performance recirculation system in this range hood eliminates the need for an expensive and bulky duct and make-up air (MUA) machinery. This range hood is an excellent choice for home designs that are focused on energy efficiency, Passivhaus, and LEED standards.
Stainless steel and advanced composites are used in the construction of all Futuro Futuro range hoods, including the "Balance" range hood. A 3-year warranty is included, and we offer the assistance of our expert consultant team, to answer any questions that you or your architect / contractor / designer may have.

Its minimalist rectangular shape, quiet operation, and advanced filtration capabilities are sure to please chefs and designers alike.
This kitchen ventilation hood is produced in a 36" wide format that accommodates the most popular cooktop sizes (24", 30", and 36"). For larger cooktops, 2 units can be installed next to each other. An innovative mounting system allows installation in any part of the kitchen - so whether your cooktop is on an island, next to a wall, or even in front of a window - this hood will work. Even angled ceilings aren''t a problem.
This model is available in 3 colors (Pure Black, Matte Charcoal, and Opaque White), so you can choose the perfect color for your kitchen space. The White model in particular is a popular choice, as that color works with any palette and style. Even in an all-black kitchen, a dramatic counterpoint of white may be just the perfect masterstroke.
Our design &amp; engineering teams have combined high-tech features, advanced materials, and powerful filtration, to create a unique and desirable kitchen ventilation solution. In particular, the “Perimeter Suction System" is a radical improvement over traditional exposed filters. This patented technology draws air around a central deflector panel, so the airflow is shaped into an “air curtain", leaving odors and steam no chance to escape.
The grease-capturing filters are cleverly concealed behind the panel - you don''t need to see them unless you''re about to pop them out for a rinse in the dishwasher. The system is also quieter, since the blower (already one of the quietest on the market) is also located behind the panel, and its operational noise is partially absorbed by the panel.
With 4 speed options, from 150 to 940 CFM, you have full control over your kitchen ventilation experience. Instead of complicated buttons, there''s a single rotary switch in the corner, which controls both lighting and fan speeds with one simple motion.
LED light strip encircles the entire perimeter, so the lighting is smooth and even across the entire cooking surface. It''s color-balanced to 3000 Kelvin, which is closest to natural daylight, so you can see what you''re cooking perfectly.
Odors are trapped by “Micro Carbon Infusion Filter" cartridges, which use activated charcoal and last for up to FIVE YEARS. Compare this with the typical “recirculating range hood" filters that last only a couple of months - it''s a major reduction in ongoing expense and annoyance. Instead of designing a recirculation option as an afterthought, our engineers focused on air purification first, and the result is the patented “Air Loop" system. No chimneys, no ducts, no negative pressure issues, no make-up air pumps, no wasted heat or air conditioning - just clean air. Perfect for today''s energy-conscious home designs that aspire to LEED and Passivhaus standards.
All Futuro Futuro range hoods are designed and built in Italy, using the highest-quality stainless steel and advanced composites. That''s why we can confidently offer a 3-year warranty on all our products. Our experienced sales consultants will be glad to address any questions.

It combines a sleek shape, advanced filtration technology, versatile installation, and quiet yet powerful operation - to deliver a kitchen appliance that looks as great as it
performs.
Available in 3 colors - Pure Black, Matte Charcoal, and Opaque White - to fit any kitchen design or color scheme. The 36" width accommodates the most popular cooktop sizes (24", 30", or 36"), and the versatile mounting system means it can be installed anywhere - over an island, next to a wall, or even in front of a window. It even fits angled ceilings!
The Black version of this range hood is perfect for kitchens where black and dark-gray shades predominate. However, it can also be a dramatic counterpoint to an all-white kitchen with black appliances. Either way, it''s a beautiful and modern addition, far from the looks of traditional bulky stainless steel range hoods.
A powerful yet quiet blower offers 4 selectable speeds, from 150 to 940 CFM. Airflow is enhanced by the innovative “Perimeter Suction System", which draws air into collector slots around a deflector panel, creating an air-curtain effect. This improves capture performance and distributes suction more evenly, avoiding the suction loss on the sides that''s common with traditional mesh or baffle filters. In addition, the deflector panel reduces noise, and conceals the mesh filters until you remove them for cleaning in the dishwasher. Better suction, lower noise, and cleaner looks - it''s a win-win-win!
Lighting is provided by an LED strip around the entire perimeter, for smooth and even illumination. The 3000K color balance replicates natural daylight, so you can see your cooking creations exactly as they are. LEDs are energy-efficient, providing the equivalent of 150 watts of light for only 26 watts, and they last 20+ years - no need to worry about replacing light bulbs.
Odors are filtered by the patented “Air Loop" recirculating system, which uses specially-designed “Micro Carbon Infusion Filter" cartridges that last a whopping FIVE YEARS. Compared to the traditional charcoal filters which must be replaced every 2-3 months, this is a major reduction in ongoing expenses and hassle. The MCIF filter permanently captures odors in the microscopic pores of activated charcoal granules.
Since this range hood is designed around high-performance recirculation, it does not need an expensive and bulky duct, or additional make-up air (MUA) machinery. This makes it an excellent choice for home designs seeking to accommodate the energy efficiency requirements such as LEED, Passivhaus, and others.
Like all other Futuro Futuro range hoods, the “Balance" range hood is made in Italy from the highest-grade AISI 304 stainless steel and advanced composites. It''s covered by a 3-year warranty, and our dedicated experts are ready to consult with your designer, architect, and installer, to ensure the best product selection and proper installation.

Made in Italy from the highest-grade materials, this classic kitchen hood offers advanced technology and exceptional performance. The purpose of a range hood is to capture the grease, steam, and waste heat, and eliminate it from the cooking area - and the Fano model line delivers the necessary performance in style.
With its gunmetal-black finish, studded reinforcement panels, and straight lines, the Fano range hood adds a bold and modern statement to a variety of kitchen styles. This black range hood is 48 inches wide, making it the perfect finishing touch to your kitchen design. It will become the center of attention and complement your black, black-stainless, slate, and stainless-steel appliances.
The Fano range hood is made from the highest-grade materials and is backed by the Futuro Futuro warranty and support network. It’s the perfect choice for completing a high-end appliance package in a luxury kitchen. The Fano vent hood provides excellent suction with low noise and easy maintenance. Whether your cooking equipment of choice is electric, induction, or gas, this kitchen exhaust fan has got you covered.
The whisper-quiet blower has 4 selectable speeds, ranging from 150 to 940 CFM, to accommodate a variety of cooking styles. Unlike typical range hoods, whose blowers are so loud that chefs often don’t use them, our products are the result of 30+ years of research and engineering, so you get up to 940 CFM airflow with only 3.2 sones of noise - equal to a normal conversation. Yes, you CAN have kitchen ventilation that’s actually a pleasure to use!
The Fano range hood uses multi-layer metal mesh filters, which are easily removable and dishwasher-safe. Control buttons are located on the underside of the unit, front and center, making them easily reachable. Three powerful LED lights provide brilliant and even illumination of the entire cooking surface, so you can see exactly how your culinary creations are turning out.
Installation is easy, thanks to a modular mounting system, adjustable chimney cover, and an innovative blower cage that can be turned to route the duct into the wall or upward to the ceiling. There are no specialized tools or knowledge necessary - this hood can be installed by any appliance or cabinet installer, handyman, or contractor.
For situations where an outside duct is not feasible, such as high-rise condos and historic co-ops, there’s an option to use charcoal filters to scrub the odors, so the hood can operate in “ductless” or “recirculating” mode. The Fano range hood provides quiet performance, versatile looks, high-quality construction, and advanced technology, making it the perfect choice for your dream kitchen.
All Futuro Futuro kitchen ventilation hoods are made in Italy and include a 1-year US standard parts &amp; labor warranty, plus an additional 2-year parts warranty, and the full support of our technical team for pre-sale and installation questions.

But now, Futuro Futuro has created a solution - the "Kelvin" series of designer built-in range hoods. "Kelvin" is equipped with a color-changing LED that allows you to adjust and transition the light temperature from "cool-white" to "warm-white" to "day-light" or any shade in between.
Ultra-efficient LED light strip creates a smooth and even illumination across the entire cooking surface. It''s located in the air diverter - another innovation that is proven to be more effective in capturing smoke and odors, by redirecting range hood''s suction from its center to the outer perimeter. The Kelvin hood is also equipped with a color-changing illuminated speed control, which allows you to easily see the current speed even though the hood is mounted inside the cabinet.

The Kelvin "Inox" build-in range hood is made with Italian craftsmanship from the highest grade AISI 304 stainless steel with high resistance to both corrosion and rust due to a higher portion of Chromium in the steel making AISI 304 the Gold standard for stainless steel appliances. The Kelvin Inox fits any standard kitchen cabinet at 30" wide and includes the blower, filters and all mounting hardware.

The grease filters are easily removable and are dishwasher-safe for quick and easy maintenance. The airflow is provided by Futuro Futuro''s 940-CFM blower with a patented design - extremely quiet performance even at the highest speed. The blower is mounted in a special reversible cage, so during installation you can decide to vent the hood upward or through the wall.
